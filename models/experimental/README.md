# Experimental Code
This folder contains code for individual experiments and not intended to be part of the core library. The code here is subject to change and may be removed at any time.

- [Byte Level](byte_level) - This includes components for building models that operate on the byte level
- [Next Thought](next_thought) - This includes components that are intended to function on a latent - latent basis, rather than a token - token basis.
- [Huggingface Interface](hugging_face.py) - this just wraps the huggingface models in our interface so that we can test those models with our code, and compare them to our models fairly.
